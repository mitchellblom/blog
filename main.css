FOR EACH ARTICLE -----
	A different background color.

	A different font size.
	A different font color.
	A different line height.
	A different padding value.
	Each should have a border, but with rounded corners of different size 
	(e.g. one article could have barely rounded borders, but the next one could be almost circular in shape)
